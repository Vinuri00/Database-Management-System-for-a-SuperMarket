Information Management and Retrieval Group project - Implementing a Database system for Supermarket
developed a supermarket management system using Microspft SQL Server Management Studio that included data validation mechanisms, triggers, user-defined functions, views, and stored procedures. We have included an ER Diagram showing all of the entities, their attributes, relationships, participation constraints, relational mapping, and cardinality ratio.
